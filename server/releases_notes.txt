1.1.2
------
- Migration to jacorb 3.4
- Events: do not check criteria for boolean attributes
- Fix Init command: it was possible to launch several init in parallel when the init is detached (@Init(lazyLoading = true)).
- Server with several class: class startup order was not the order on insertion done with org.tango.server.ServerManager#addClass
- No db devices: only the last added class is used.
